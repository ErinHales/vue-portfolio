        <p>I never expected to be a web developer. It's not that I had any bias against it, but rather that it was never
                    an option. I simply didn't know about it. It wasn't until 2017 that I had a discussion with an old friend
                    who is now a web developer. This encouraged me to look into the field. What I found was that I loved
                    it! It satisfied my itch for problem solving and also design. I found that hours spent in front of the
                    computer passed quickly.</p>
        <p>When I decided to go to Dev Mountain (a three month intensive program), I knew that it was going to be a
                    really hard thing, so I spent months preparing. Every day when I got home from work, I would spend 3-4
                    hours going through courses on Free Code Camp and building small projects. I learned that I was good
                    at coding and quick at catching on to new topics.</p>
        <p>Dev Mountain was an amazing experience, and it helped me realize that I can do hard things. And now that it's behind me, I am eager to start the next phase of my career as a web developer.</p>
